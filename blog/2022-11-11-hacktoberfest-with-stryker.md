At Stryker we can look back at a very successful Hacktoberfest this year! In the last weekend of October we got together with other open-sourcerers to help reduce the number of outstanding issues on our stryker projects.

The hackathon was sponsored by Info Support, this is in addition to the regular sponsoring.

# Accomplishments

During the hackathon we worked on a variety of issues. From small bug fixes to large features that have been in progress for months. Not all work has resulted in merged PRs but everyone learned a lot.
