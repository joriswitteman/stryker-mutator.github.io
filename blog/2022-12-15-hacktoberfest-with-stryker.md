At Stryker we can look back at a very successful Hacktoberfest this year! In the last weekend of October we got together with other open-sourcerers to help reduce the number of outstanding issues on our stryker projects.

The hackathon was sponsored by Info Support, this is in addition to the regular sponsoring.

# Accomplishments

During the hackathon we worked on a variety of issues. From small bug fixes to large features that have been in progress for months. Not all work has resulted in merged PRs but everyone learned a lot.

Let's take a look at what we have accomplished in just two days of hacking:

## Stryker JS

## Stryker.NET

- Feat: [Add mutator for Math class](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net/pull/2244)
- Feat: [Add mutator for `??=`](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net/pull/2274)

## Mutation testing elements (report)

- Feat: [Replace bootstrap with tailwind](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements/pull/2160)

## See you next year?

Given the big success of this years hacktoberfest hackathon we will for sure organise one next year as well! The hackathon will be hosted in The Netherlands but is setup as a hybrid event so can be joined online as well.

# Stryker.NET 3.1

The new Stryker.NET is packed with a lot of new awesome features ðŸš€

## Test whole solution

A long awaited feature is finally here!

```
cd C:\myproject\
dotnet stryker -s "C:\myproject\mysolution.sln"
```

When running from your project root (where your solution file is located) and passing the solution file Stryker will analyze your solution and mutate all projects it can find.

## Math mutations

Stryker will now mutate math methods when it encounters them. All available mutations are:

| Original                 | Mutated                  |

## Object initializer mutation

```cs
var myObject = new MyClass() {
    property1 = "",
    property2 = Int.MaxValue
}
```

Will be mutated into an empty object initializer:

```cs
var myObject = new MyClass() {
}
```

## Null coalesing assignment mutation

```cs
var object1 ??= object2;
```

Will be mutated into:

```cs
var object1 = object2;

```
