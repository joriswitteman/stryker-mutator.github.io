At Stryker we can look back at a very successful Hacktoberfest this year! On the last weekend of October, we got together with other 'open-sourcerers' to help reduce the number of outstanding issues on our Stryker projects.

Info Support sponsored the hackathon, in addition to the regular sponsoring.
